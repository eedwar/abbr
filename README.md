# ABBR. 

### Experience a2z. 2022. 

#### Aim : get my head back into Processing. Wasn't so much a learning point but felt necessary to do for the first letter. 

#### Keywords : pixels, edge detection, PGraphics, mouse, pink.  
#### How to use
- Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download) if you don't have it installed already 
- Download this show & tell branch 
- Open the sketch
- Run the sketch ( ▶️ button )
- Mouse press at different points along the line
- Press 's' to save out a frame ( saves to sketch directory )
- Have fun, esc & replay to start again. 


#### A Snazzy Video

#### Some things on Improvements to be made
- For sure some more tidying up could be done
- There's definitley some repetivative code in there that should be made into functions 
- Maybe some different could options for the user would be nice 
- Also for the user to choose their own text

#### Some notes on why I did what I did 
- hmm. For fun. 
- Wanted to play in Processing but realised I was out of practice, so spent more energy reminding my brain how to function. 
- I know the text/font capabilities aren't great for quality in Processing which is why I went down the pixel from image route. Although in the end, the overall look is not that high resolution because of the sizes of the circles in the PGraphics, so perhaps this could be rethought.  
- I had a vague idea to pull lines out from the letters towards the mouse, that was my little starting point. 
- I like pink.
