### Experience a2z. 2022. 

#### Aim : get my head back into Processing. Wasn't so much a learning point but felt necessary to do for the first letter. 

#### How to use
- Download Processing if you don't have it installed already 
- Download this show & tell branch 
- Open the sketch
- Run the sketch ( ▶️ button )
- Mouse press at different points along the line
- Press 's' to save out a frame ( saves to sketch directory )
- Have fun, esc & replay to start again.
